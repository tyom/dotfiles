# Explain Code

Explain the following: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Approach

1. **Read** - Examine the code and its surrounding context (imports, callers, tests)
2. **Clarify scope** - If unclear, ask what aspect needs explanation:
   - High-level overview (what it does, why)
   - Detailed walkthrough (line-by-line logic)
   - Specific concept (algorithm, pattern, framework usage)
   - Data flow (inputs → transformations → outputs)
3. **Explain** - Provide clear explanation at the appropriate level
4. **Offer depth** - Ask if more detail is needed on any part

## Explanation Structure

Adapt based on what's being explained:

- **Overview**: Purpose, problem being solved, how it fits in the system
- **Logic**: Algorithm, control flow, key decisions
- **Data**: Types, structures, transformations
- **Patterns**: Design patterns, idioms, conventions used
- **Dependencies**: External calls, integrations, side effects

## Guidelines

- Start with the "why" before the "how"
- Use analogies for complex concepts
- Highlight non-obvious or clever parts
- Note potential gotchas or edge cases
- Avoid restating what's already clear from the code
